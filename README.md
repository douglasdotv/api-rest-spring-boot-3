# spring-boot-api-rest

By doing this, I learned:

- how to start a new project with Spring Initializr
- the basics of a Spring Boot project configuration
- how to to persist data using Spring Data JPA
- how to map entities
- how to deal with controllers and repositories
- how to apply DTO pattern and why it's important
- how to validate data
- how to use Lombok to reduce the amount of boilerplate code
- how to perform migrations via Flyway
- and, ultimately, how to build a REST API with basic CRUD operations

I have plans to learn about proper API protection, Spring Security, tests and deploy in the future.
